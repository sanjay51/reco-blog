# Add new pages to greeting cards

** Short answer: New pages are automatically added. **

By default, a greeting card gets two blank pages when created. However, with [Recocards](https://recocards.com), you always get unlimited messages, unlimited signers and unlimited pages.

As soon as you or someone adds a message on the last blank page of the card, a new page automatically gets appended.

## Example
You create a greeting card â€“ by default you get a cover page, two empty pages, and the last page. You (or anyone) add a message on the 2nd empty page.
A 3rd page automatically gets appended to the card.

## Conclusion
With Recocards, you always get unlimited number of pages for all our online group greeting cards.
