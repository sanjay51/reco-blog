# Password reset email not received

You tried resetting your password, but didn't get a reset link in email.

This can happen due to many reasons:
- The reset email landed in your spam folder. In this case check your spam folder.
- Your email provider or company is blocking emails from @recocards.com. In that case, please reach out to them to allow-list these emails.

There are few other options:

## Case 1: You remember your current password
In this case, you can login to your account, and go to `Dashboard -> My Account` and change your email address.

## Case 2: You are already logged in
In this case, you can go to `Dashboard -> My Account` and change your email address.

## Case 3: You're not logged in and you don't remember your current password
Well, the only options are 
- Reach out to your email provider or company to understand why they are blocking emails from RecoCards. 
- The only other option is to create a new account with a different email. Unfortunately, you will lose access to your existing cards.
