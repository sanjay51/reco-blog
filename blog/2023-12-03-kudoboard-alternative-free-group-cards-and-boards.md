Recocards.com is an online platform that allows groups of people to create and sign digital greeting cards or greeting boards for special occasions such as work anniversaries, promotions, birthdays, baby showers, retirements, and more. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and allows the organizer to invite others to contribute to the card or board by signing or adding messages and photos.

Recocards.com offers a variety of templates and designs to choose from for card covers and card sign stickers, and users can also upload their own photos and artwork to create a personalized greeting card. The platform also includes features such as the ability to schedule the delivery of the card, send reminders to contributors, and track the progress of the card.

Once the card or board is complete, the creator can choose to share it digitally via email, social media, or a unique link, or they can download a high-quality image of the finalized card or board to create personalized memorabilia products.
